## Usage

The Tumblr shard is **very** much a work in progress.  The Tumblr V1 API will 
be implemented first (as it less complex and doesn't require OAuth).  

```crystal
require "tumblr"
```

Currently, only the unauthenticated V1 API is beginning to be implemented.
You can get a blog's feed like so:

```cr
a = Tumblr::Simple::Client.get_all("staff")
puts a.inspect
```
